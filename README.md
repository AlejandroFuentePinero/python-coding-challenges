# Python Coding Challenges
### This repo is for daily coding practice; not a polished project
A collection of short (30–60 minute) narrative-style coding projects designed to build fluency in **Python reasoning, design thinking, and practical problem-solving**.  
Each challenge focuses on clear logic, clean code structure, and purposeful use of core Python tools.
