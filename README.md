# Python Coding Challenges

A growing collection of short (10–60 min) narrative-style coding projects designed to strengthen **Python reasoning, design thinking, and problem-solving fluency**.

Each challenge mirrors a realistic mini-scenario — from small data systems and automation tasks to analysis workflows — encouraging you to decide how to approach them (loops, functions, classes, data structures, etc.) without step-by-step instructions.

---

## Format
- **Level 1–4 scaffolding** (from guided to autonomous)
- Each challenge includes:
  - Plain-English problem description
  - Constraints or rules
  - Optional warm-ups
  - Core tasks and acceptance checks
  - Stretch goals or optimisations

## Contents
| # | Project | Focus | Level |
|---|----------|--------|--------|
| 01 | Grades Tracker | Dictionaries, loops, functions | Easy |
| 02 | Sensor Data Sanity Check | Validation, loops, list comprehensions, conditionals | Easy |
| 03 | Clean Messy Scores | Data cleaning, type conversion, error handling, NaN detection | Easy-Medium |
| 04 | Budget Tracker | Dictionaries, loops, aggregation, sorting, user input, error handling | Medium |

## Goals
Build strong intuition for:
- Structuring small systems from scratch
- Choosing the right data structures
- Writing clean, modular Python code
- Thinking like a data scientist *and* a programmer
