# Python Coding Challenges

A growing collection of short (10–60 min) narrative-style coding projects designed to strengthen **Python reasoning, design thinking, and problem-solving fluency**.

Each challenge mirrors a realistic mini-scenario — from small data systems and automation tasks to analysis workflows — encouraging you to decide how to approach them (loops, functions, classes, data structures, etc.) without step-by-step instructions.

## Format
- **Level 1–4 scaffolding** (from guided to autonomous)
- Each challenge includes:
  - Plain-English problem description
  - Constraints or rules
  - Optional warm-ups
  - Core tasks and acceptance checks
  - Stretch goals or optimisations

## Goals
Build strong intuition for:
- Structuring small systems from scratch
- Choosing the right data structures
- Writing clean, modular Python code
- Thinking like a data scientist *and* a programmer
